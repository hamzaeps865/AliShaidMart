  Creating an optimized production build ...
Γ¿» ERROR: This build 
is using Turbopack, 
with a `webpack` 
config and no 
`turbopack` config.
   This may be a 
mistake.

   As of Next.js 16 
Turbopack is enabled 
by default and
   custom webpack 
configurations may 
need to be migrated 
to Turbopack.

   NOTE: your 
`webpack` config may 
have been added by a 
configuration plugin.

   To configure 
Turbopack, see https:/
/nextjs.org/docs/app/a
pi-reference/next-conf
ig-js/turbopack

   TIP: Many 
applications work 
fine under Turbopack 
with no configuration,
   if that is the 
case for you, you can 
silence this error by 
passing the
   `--turbopack` or 
`--webpack` flag 
explicitly or simply 
setting an 
   empty turbopack 
config in your Next 
config file (e.g. 
`turbopack: {}`).
